# Ebooky

Ebooky is a webapp where users can add, edit, or delete a book. Each book has a title and an author. Also, users can download the list of books (to CSV and XML).

This is my first application built with Laravel framework as an assignment by Yaraku (translation software start-up based in Tokyo).
